There are three types of variable in java local instance static.
Local Variables:
   Are the variables which are created inside a block of code like method,
   loop switch statements if else condition or constructor.
Pros:
   We should always prefer local variables over instance or static variables
   because they live for the shortest period of time inside your RAM
Cons:
   They can't be accessed outside of the block of code in which they are created
