What is a method:
   Method in java is block of code (group of java statements). It defines the behavior of the a class

*Why we should use methods:
   1)it helps us remove the duplicate code from our applications. We just create a method and every time
   we need that logic we just call the method that contains the logic
   2)It also allows to write the code in the form of modules which makes
   the development of large applications easier

*How to use Methods:
   1) First we create a method inside a class
   2) We create the object of that class
   3) We call the method by writing the name of the object a dot name of the method

*Class Calculator{
void add(int x, int y){
System.out.println(x+y);
}
public static void main (String [] args){
Calculator cal=new Calculator();
cal.add(10,20);
}
}
*Rules to create and use methods:
*void=> void is a return type and it is a must if you want to return a specific data write the name of that data type
like for integer we write int
for String we write String if we don't want to return anything we write void
When we write a void we can't assign a method call to a variable


*add=> next we write the name of the method which can be anything it should follow the rules for giving a name to a variable
*()=> We specify tha data parameters here we can pass any data type inside these parenthesis
      They are optional we can leave them empty
 *{
 System.out.println();
 }  - the body of the method that contains the java statements
 * add(int x, int y)=> This part with the name of the method and its parameters is called signature of a method
 * void add (int x, int y) - header of the method

 ======================================================
 type of Variables in Java:
 there are three type variables in java.
 1. Local variable:
  if a variable is inside a method or a part of its parameters or a loop
 or switch statement it is called a local variable.
 2. Instance variable:
  if a variable is inside the class but outside of any block of code like method loop
 switch statement if else condition it is called an instance variable.
 3. Static variable:
 if an instance variable has a static keyword with it then it is called a static variable

 Why learn about different types of variables :
   1) It helps us reduce the amount of RAM that our application will be using when it will be running
   2) With the help of these variables we can pass information between methods of class
   3)They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time as soon as your method is done executing they are
   destroyed by a special program called garbage collector

 How to use these:
 Local: create inside block of code

 Pros and cons

 Local variables:
   pros: they occupy the memory for the shortest period of time always try to use local variables when possible
   cons: they are very limited in scope means we can't access them outside of method or that block of code
 Instance variables:
   pros: they have broader scope as compared to local variables means we can access in all the methods of that class
   cons: they occupy the space in your RAM for longer periods of time
 Static variables:
   pros: we can call static variables without creating an object of a class
         we can share a single value between all the objects of a class
   cons:
